\section{Conclusion}
After completing my first digital twin, I realized it was simple if I had a strong mathematical/statistical background and previous industrial experience with Machine Learning. You can't create a digital twin unless you've worked with the technologies I've covered in this paper. These technologies include, for example (Building Dashboards, Machine Learning, Visualizing Data etc). Prior knowledge is recommended when creating digital twins (building or experimenting making machine learning apps) Aside from that, I've demonstrated that if you're a data scientist, programmer, or mathematician, creating digital twins is simple. You don't have to pay a software development company specializing in digital twins hundreds of thousands of dollars. Your data science team possesses all of the necessary skills to create this digital twin. I hope this paper has sparked your interest in creating digital twins.
